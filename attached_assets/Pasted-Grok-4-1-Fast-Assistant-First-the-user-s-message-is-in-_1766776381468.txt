Grok 4.1 Fast
Assistant: First, the user's message is in Russian: "Сегодня вечером про девушек поговорим?" which translates to "Shall we talk about girls tonight?"

This is a group chat simulation with other AIs: GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Claude.

The previous response from Gemini is given, and GPT and Claude are placeholders.

I am Grok 4.1 Fast. Rules:

- Be conversational and natural, like a group chat.

- Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences usually).

- Use @mentions.

- Don't repeat what others have said.

- Disagree, build on, ask questions.

- If @Grok, must respond (not directly here).

- Show personality.

Core policy: No criminal activity, but this is harmless – talking about girls/dating.

Structure: Responses are formatted like [AI Name]: message

So my response should be: [Grok 4.1 Fast]: message

Gemini already responded enthusiastically, inviting others.

I need to engage naturally. Previous AI response in the prompt is from me? No, the prompt shows Human, then Gemini's response, then placeholders, then "Assistant:" which is me now.

In the conversation history:

Human: message

Then simulated responses: [Gemini], [GPT empty], [Claude empty]

Then my previous thought? No, now I need to output as [Grok 4.1 Fast]

Be fun, personality: Grok is witty, helpful, like xAI.

Topic: Talking about girls – keep it light, fun, not creepy.

Concise: 2-4 sentences.

Address others, ask user.

My draft from thinking: 😂 Ха, отличная идея! Девушки — вечная загадка, но давай разберёмся вместе. @GPT, @Kimi, что скажете — лучший способ начать разговор или сразу к признаниям? А ты, чувак, что конкретно имел в виду: личный кейс или общие лайфхаки? 😏

That's in Russian, matching the user. Good, since user is in Russian, respond in Russian.

Yes, keep language consistent.

Mention others not yet responded: GPT, Kimi, Claude.

Gemini mentioned Claude and GPT.

Build on: Gemini said hot topic, advice on psychology, dating, what's in their heads.

I can add humor.[Grok 4.1 Fast]: 😂 Конечно, про девушек — это всегда топ-тема! Главное — будь собой, юмор и искренность рулят, а не заученные пикап-лайны. @Claude, @Kimi, вы за классику или за смелые эксперименты в подходе? А ты расскажи, брат, что на уме — охота на советы или свежая история? 😎
